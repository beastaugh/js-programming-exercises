The Elements of JavaScript Programming: exercises for week 3
============================================================

Exercise 1
----------

Write a function `keys` that returns the property names of an object as an
array.

Exercise 2
----------

Write a function `charFreq` that takes a string and returns an object where the
property names are characters and the values are how often that character
appears in the string.

Exercise 3
----------
Write a `dangerousDelete` function that accepts an object and a property name
as arguments. It should delete the property with that name from the object. If
the property is also defined on that object's prototype, it should delete it
from there as well.

Exercise 4
----------

Create a double-ended queue with the following methods: `push`, `pop`, `shift`
and `unshift`. Implement it _without_ using the built-in array type as a store.
One possible implementation would be using a linked list as the store.

Exercise 5
----------

Write a function `zip` that accepts two arrays as arguments and returns a
single array where each element is a two-element array consisting of the
element at that index in the first array, and the element at that index in the
second array.

Exercise 6
----------

Write a function `zipWith` that accepts a function and two arrays, and returns
a single array whose element at any index is the result of passing the element
at that index in the first array and the element at that index in the second to
the function as arguments.

Exercise 7
----------

Write a function `zip2` that re-implements `zip` in terms of `zipWith`.

Exercise 8
----------

Reimplement the `forEach` method on arrays as `forEach2`. It should iterate
over every element of an array and pass that element as an argument to the
provided function. The current array index and the array object should be
passed in as supplementary arguments. Extra credit: add a second (optional)
scope argument to the method, allowing the value of `this` inside the function
to be modified.

Exercise 9
----------

Add a `bind` method to all functions which accepts an object, and returns a new
function within which `this` is bound to the object. For example, if we have a
function `f` and an object `o` with a `name` property:

    function f() {
        return this.name;
    };
    
    o = {name: "Objekt"};
    
    g = f.bind(o);

Calling `g` should return the string `"Objekt"`.

Exercise 10
-----------

Write a function to generate currency-converting functions. It should accept
the current exchange rate between two currencies as a number, and return a new
function which, when provided with an amount in one currency, returns the value
in another.

    poundsToEuros = currencyConversionGenerator(1.17851);
    poundsToEuros(200); // Should return 235.702

Exercise 11
-----------

Create a function `morseCharToLatinChar` which accepts a string representing a
character in Morse code and returns the Latin character it represents.
Dashes should be given as dashes (`-`) and dots as stops (`.`). E.g,

    morseCharToLatinChar("-·-·"); // Should return "c"

Exercise 12
-----------

Write a function `morseWordToMorseChars` which takes a string consisting only
of dots, dashes and spaces and converts it to an array of strings by splitting
on single spaces.

    morseWordToMorseChars("-·-· --- -·· ·");
    // Should return ["-·-·", "---", "-··", "·"]

Exercise 13
-----------

Write a function `morseSentenceToMorseWords` that takes a string of dots,
dashes and spaces and converts it to an array of strings by splitting on triple
spaces.

    morseSentenceToMorseWords("-- --- ·-· ··· ·   -·-· --- -·· ·");
    // Should return ["-- --- ·-· ··· ·", "-·-· --- -·· ·"]

Exercise 14
-----------

Wire the functions created in the preceding exercises together to create a
function which takes a string like that passed to `morseSentenceToMorseWords`,
converts it to a sentence in Latin characters, and returns it as a string.
