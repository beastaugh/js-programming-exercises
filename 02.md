The Elements of JavaScript Programming: exercises for week 2
============================================================

Exercise 1
----------

Create an object with a method `hello` that returns the string "Hello, world".

Exercise 2
----------

Write a function `detectType` which accepts one argument and prints the type of
that argument if it is a primitive or, if it is an object, which of
JavaScript's built-in objects it is an instance of.

Exercise 3
----------

Define a function `buildObject` that accepts a constructor, creates a new
instance of that constructor, and passes any additional arguments to the
constructor as an array.

Exercise 4
----------

Create a function `extendObject` that extends one object with another---that
is, copies the properties of the second object onto the first---and then
returns the extended object.

Exercise 5
----------

Make a constructor `Stack` that creates objects with two methods, `push` and
`pop`. The `push` method should add an object to end of the stack, the `pop`
method should remove the last object on the stack. Calling `pop` on an empty
stack should return `null`. The stack should be initially empty.

Exercise 6
----------

Modify the `Stack` constructor so that it can accept an array of initial
elements.

Exercise 7
----------

Create a `Queue` object that functions like `Stack`, but the other way round:
it should have a `shift` method that removes the first object in the queue, and
an `unshift` method that adds an object to the beginning of the queue. Like
`Stack` the constructor should accept an array to define its initial state.
